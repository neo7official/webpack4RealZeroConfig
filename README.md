# Weback4 Real Zero Configure Setup
------------------------------------------------
Webpack 4 comes with a new idea, 0 configuration setting. If you have only one entry point then you don't need this setup. Webpack 4 will compile your project without any regression. But, if you are working on a project which has multiple entry point then 0 configuration setting will not work and that is where you can take benefit of this project.
