# Weback4 Real Zero Configure Setup with Multiple entry point
**React Ready (ie9+ Supported), Babel, SASS, HTML Partials, External jQuery CDN**

Webpack 4 comes with a new idea, 0 configuration setting. If you have only one entry point then you don't need this setup. Webpack 4 will compile your project without any regression. But, if you are working on a project which has multiple entry point then 0 configuration setting will not work and that is where you can take benefit of this project.

This setup will detect all entry points automatically from 'src/js' folder. You should remember that this folder should not contain any other file other than entry points in its root, though you can always create sub folders and put any other javascript files there.
